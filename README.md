# Server Health Checker

**server health checker** is a python application developed using 
Fabric/Paramiko that will take a list of servers and display critical
information 

3) Imagine you are Linux administrator for a company. 
You are managing 10 machines. You want to write a Python program using modules like 
fabric or paramiko to find the usage of these machines. The information might include 
CPU load, memory used, available disk space, number of logged in users etc. The program 
must run hourly and should save the above information into a csv file, excel file or in 
a database. You might have to use modules like csv, xlwt, sqlite etc. If a query is made 
to find out load on a specific machine or the load on all the machines at a specific 
time, you should return the results.
